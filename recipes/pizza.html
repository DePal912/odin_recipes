        <p> I would marry a pizza if I was <strong>LEGALLY ALLOWED TO!</strong> But alas, this country is not accepting of the LGBTQPizza lifestyle. So I guess I will just have to SHOW you how I feel.</P>
            <p> Have you ever had pizza so good that you literally become oppressed by a pizza demon? No? Oh me neither. How crazy would that be?</p>
